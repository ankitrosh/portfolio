# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders

Yesterday, I wrapped up a project applying deep autoencoder models to a 60-day telecom KPI dataset spanning 100 cellular sites and multiple sectors. With no labeled anomalies available, I relied on reconstruction error to flag outliers and uncover hidden performance issues across various network metrics.

## The Challenge: Finding Outliers in High-Dimensional KPI Data

The dataset combined daily measurements—signal strength, throughput, CPU load, and more—across dozens of sectors. Traditional thresholding struggled to adapt to varying site conditions. I needed a model capable of learning normal patterns and highlighting deviations automatically.

## The Autoencoder Solution

Autoencoders learn a compact representation of data and attempt to reconstruct inputs at the output layer. When reconstruction error is high, the input likely deviates from the learned “normal” manifold.

### 1. Encoder-Decoder Architecture

- **Encoder**: Compresses 10-dimensional KPI vectors into a 3-unit latent space.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the original vector from the latent code.
- **Bottleneck**: Forces the network to capture only the most salient features.

### 2. Reconstruction Error as Anomaly Score

After training, each sample’s mean squared error between input and reconstruction serves as its anomaly score. High-error points are flagged for further investigation.

## Data Preprocessing: Ready for Training

- **Normalization**: Scaled each KPI to zero mean and unit variance per site.
- **Missing Data**: Imputed gaps using forward fill within each time series.
- **Batching**: Grouped by site and date, shuffled into mini-batches of 64 samples.

## Model Training and Hyperparameters

- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error
- **Optimizer**: Adam (learning rate = 0.001)
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Early Stopping**: Patience = 5 epochs on validation loss

## Evaluation: Distinguishing Normal vs. Anomalous

- **Threshold Selection**: Set at the 95th percentile of validation reconstruction errors.
- **ROC Analysis**: Verified separation between normal and synthetic anomalies.
- **Top Anomalies**: Reviewed the top 10 highest-error samples for manual validation.

## Results and Insights

The autoencoder successfully isolated days where Site 42’s download throughput dipped sharply and Sector 7 experienced unexpected CPU spikes. Visualizing reconstruction errors over time revealed recurring patterns tied to maintenance windows.

## Best Practices and Lessons Learned

1. **Robust Preprocessing**: Normalization per site is critical to avoid bias.
2. **Latent-Space Tuning**: Smaller bottlenecks force better generalization, but risk under-fitting.
3. **Threshold Calibration**: Percentile-based thresholds adapt across different KPIs.
4. **Visualization**: Plotting error distributions quickly highlights outlier clusters.
5. **Modular Code**: Abstract preprocessing, model definition, and evaluation into reusable functions.

## Future Work: Towards Real-Time Monitoring

- **Streaming Inference**: Deploy the autoencoder as a microservice for real-time scoring.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Update thresholds dynamically based on rolling error windows.
- **Multi-KPI Fusion**: Extend to multivariate sequence autoencoders for temporal anomaly detection.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the power of unsupervised autoencoders for uncovering hidden anomalies in complex telecom datasets. By learning normal operational patterns, the model provided an automated, scalable approach to network monitoring—and paved the way for real-time, AI-driven insights.
