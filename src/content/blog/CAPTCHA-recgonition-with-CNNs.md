# Enhancing CAPTCHA Recognition with CNNs and Image Augmentation

CAPTCHA recognition remains a challenging computer-vision task due to the wide variety of distortions, noise patterns, and font styles employed to thwart automated solvers. In this project, I designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately read CAPTCHA images, and I developed a suite of image-augmentation techniques to simulate realistic distortions—dramatically improving the model’s robustness.

## Dataset and Challenge

### Data Collection

I assembled a dataset of 100,000 CAPTCHA images scraped from multiple sources, covering alphanumeric, arithmetic, and character-overlay variants.

### CAPTCHA Variations

- **Font diversity:** 12 different typefaces, including cursive and monospace
- **Distortions:** Wave warps, rotation (±30°), perspective shear
- **Noise patterns:** Salt-and-pepper, Gaussian blur, and background clutter

### Core Challenges

1. **Unseen distortions:** Real-world CAPTCHAs often combine techniques unpredictably.
2. **Class imbalance:** Some characters appear far less frequently.
3. **Overfitting risk:** Without augmentation, the CNN memorizes training artifacts.

## CNN Architecture

### Convolutional Layers

- **Blocks of Conv→ReLU→BatchNorm:** Extract low- to mid-level features
- **Kernel sizes:** 3×3 for detail, 5×5 for broader patterns

### Pooling and Dense Layers

- **MaxPooling:** Reduces spatial dimensions while retaining salient activations
- **Fully connected layers:** Two hidden layers (256, 128 units) leading to a softmax over 36 classes (0–9, A–Z)

### Training Objective

- **Loss function:** Categorical cross-entropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam (lr=0.0005) with weight decay for regularization

## Image Augmentation Techniques

### Geometric Transformations

- **Random rotation:** ±30°
- **Perspective warp:** Simulate skewed camera angles
- **Scaling and translation:** Vary text placement

### Noise Injection

- **Salt-and-pepper:** Up to 15% pixel noise
- **Gaussian blur:** Kernel sizes 3×3 to 7×7
- **Background textures:** Overlay subtle grid or gradient patterns

### Color and Contrast Variations

- **Grayscale jitter:** Random brightness/contrast shifts (±20%)
- **Color tinting:** Blend in random RGB shifts to mimic colored backgrounds

---

## Implementation and Pipeline

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Resize** all images to 80×200 pixels
2. **Normalize** pixel values to [0,1] range
3. **Apply augmentation** on-the-fly during training with a 70% probability per image

### Model Training and Hyperparameters

- **Epochs:** 30 with early stopping (patience=5)
- **Batch size:** 128
- **Validation split:** 10% of training data

---

## Results and Insights

### Accuracy Metrics

- **Baseline (no augmentation):** 78.4%
- **With augmentation:** 94.7% on held-out test set

### Visualizing Feature Maps

Examining intermediate convolutional activations revealed that the network learns to focus on character edges and ignore background speckle.

## Realistic Transformation Strategies

### Synthetic Distortion Generation

By combining multiple augmentation types per image—rotation plus noise plus warp—the model encountered far more varied examples than in the raw dataset.

### Balancing Synthetic and Real Data

A 1:1 mix of real CAPTCHAs and heavily augmented samples yielded optimal generalization to new CAPTCHA sources.

## Lessons Learned

### Impact of Augmentation on Generalization

Thoughtfully designed transformations can reduce overfitting and enable a CNN to handle unseen distortions.

### Model Regularization

Combining dropout (rate=0.4) with batch normalization further improved stability across training runs.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that a well-architected CNN, when paired with a comprehensive, realistic augmentation pipeline, can achieve high accuracy on diverse CAPTCHA challenges. The same principles—data diversity, robust preprocessing, and careful model design—apply broadly across computer-vision tasks where input variation is the norm.
