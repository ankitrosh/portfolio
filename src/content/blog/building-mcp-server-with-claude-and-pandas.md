# Building an MCP Server with Claude and Pandas

In this post, we’ll explore how to set up a lightweight MCP (Model–Component Proxy) server that delegates requests to two core tools—Anthropic’s Claude for conversational reasoning and Pandas for in-memory data analysis. This architecture lets you serve both free-form natural-language queries and structured KPI lookups through a single FastAPI endpoint.

## Architecture Overview

Our design centers on a FastAPI application that exposes a single `/mcp` route. Incoming JSON messages specify which “tool” to invoke—either the Claude handler for open-ended prompts or the Pandas handler for tabular data queries. A central MCP router inspects the request, dispatches it to the appropriate component, and returns a unified JSON response.

## Setting Up the MCP Router

First, we instantiate a FastAPI app and register an MCPRouter that knows about each tool. The router validates incoming payloads, ensuring that only supported tools (“claude” or “pandas”) are called. This separation of concerns keeps our code clean and makes it easy to add new tools in the future.

## Integrating Claude

The Claude handler wraps the Anthropic API client. When the router receives a “claude” request, it extracts the user’s prompt, wraps it with the required human/AI delimiters, and forwards it to Claude-2. The response text is then returned directly to the client. This approach provides flexible conversational capabilities—anything from brainstorming questions to high-level explanations can be handled seamlessly.

## Data Handling with Pandas

For structured data queries, the “pandas” handler preloads a telecom KPI dataset into a DataFrame at startup. Incoming requests specify a filter expression (e.g., selecting a site and date range). The handler applies this query using Pandas’ built-in filtering, then serializes the resulting rows to JSON. This simple mechanism supports a wide range of ad-hoc analyses without needing a separate database layer.

## Example Usage

- **Conversational Query**: Send a prompt like “Summarize recent CPU utilization trends” to the Claude tool and receive a narrative explanation.
- **KPI Lookup**: Request data for “site == 42 and date >= '2025-07-01'” via the Pandas tool to get raw metrics in JSON form.

By using one unified `/mcp` endpoint, clients can seamlessly mix conversational and data-driven interactions.

## Performance & Scaling

- **Concurrency**: FastAPI’s async workers handle dozens of simultaneous requests to Claude without blocking.
- **Large Datasets**: For CSVs that exceed memory, you can chunk-load with Dask or limit queries to sliding windows.
- **Caching**: Layer in Redis to cache frequent Claude completions or Pandas query results, reducing API calls and DataFrame filtering overhead.

## Next Steps

To make this production-ready, consider adding:

- **Authentication**: Protect the `/mcp` endpoint with API keys or OAuth.
- **Streaming Responses**: Stream long Claude replies back to clients for lower latency.
- **Monitoring**: Instrument Prometheus metrics for request rates, latencies, and error counts.
- **Extensibility**: Plug in additional tools—e.g., a custom anomaly-detection service—by registering new handlers with the MCP router.

_By combining Claude’s conversational power and Pandas’ analytical speed under an MCP architecture, you can build a versatile, maintainable backend that serves both AI dialogue and structured data insights._
